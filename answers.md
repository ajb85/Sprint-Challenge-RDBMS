#Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL. _RDBMS is the system itself, SQL is a language to interact with it_

#Why do tables need a primary key? _It gives each entry a unique and identifiable column. Otherwise there might be duplicate information that is impossible to distinguish_

#What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table. _Foreign Key_

#What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables. _New table!_
